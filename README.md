🩺 ML-Based Health Risk Prediction Interface
This project aims to predict diabetes and heart stroke risks using machine learning models integrated with a Flask web application. The interface provides users with valuable health insights for proactive prevention and early intervention.

🛠️ Project Overview
The machine learning models were trained on datasets from Kaggle, and the Random Forest algorithm provided the best results for both diabetes and heart stroke predictions. The trained models were serialized using Python's pickle module for later use in the Flask application.

🚀 Workflow
📊 Model Training and Serialization:

Train the models using the Random Forest algorithm.
Serialize the trained models using pickle:
import pickle
pickle.dump(model, open('model.pkl', 'wb'))
pickled_model = pickle.load(open('model.pkl', 'rb'))
🌐 Setting Up the Virtual Environment:

Create a virtual environment:
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv env
.\env\Scripts\activate.ps1
Install Flask within the virtual environment:
pip install Flask
💻 Flask Application:

Create the Flask application in app.py:
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('home.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Run the application:
python app.py
🎨 Frontend Integration:

Design a basic HTML template (home.html) for the user interface.
Integrate the template with the Flask application.

Train ML models on Kaggle.
Serialize the models using pickle.
Set up a Flask application in a virtual environment.
Integrate the serialized models into the Flask application.
Render the HTML template to create a user-friendly interface.
